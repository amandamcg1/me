TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

This week we learnt about files and how to get information from files and how to write information into files.

Exercise 1:

- This week the exercises were ok.
- I understood how it accesses parts of a file with arrays.
- I have trouble remembering the different commands but I guess that comes with practice.
- I have found that I like to overcomplicate everything. With the diarist function I had like 20 lines of code which I managed to shorten down. I don't know why.
