TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

This was a non-teaching week so we didn't do anything in class but I did have a look at my data project. I had a look at my data and wrote a list of the type of things i want to explore in my presentation and did a bit of background research.

Things I want to explore:

- Amount of flying foxes recorded in 2019
  - Proportion of what species made up that amount
    - grey headed and spectacled are listed as threatened --> show any relation
- Mapping of flying foxes through the year
  - different species movement

Background Research:
Camps - Patch of trees flying foxes are found during the day

- The National Flying-fox Monitoring Program (NFFMP) is designed to collect data on the abundance and distribution of flying-foxes in eastern Australia.
- Counts are conducted at all known camps in the range of the grey-headed flying-fox which stretches from Adelaide through to Bundaberg and the spectacled flying-fox which is between Ingham and Cooktown in far north Queensland.

At small camps(1000<) the numbers are counted directly but at larger camps they use a sampling method.

So that's what I did. I also tried to figure out how to combine multiple datasets but wasn't very successful with that.
