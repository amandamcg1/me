TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

Week 10
This week we didn't have actual class but we still did work on our data projects. I learnt more about groupbys and what they dO. This help specifically when I was trying to groupby the date.

I also managed to figure out how to create subsub set my data by year so I could make comparision graphs.
