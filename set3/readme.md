TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

Exercise 1:

- We looked at for loops and appending items to a list which I found ok.
- We also used try and except statements which I initially found confusing but I think I am ok with them now.
- I struggled with combining functions as my brain just couldn't cope but I think it's getting easier.

Exercise 3:

- I had some trouble with this one as I managed to get all the tests passing except one which drove me insane.
- Then the super_asker function broke and kept printing the exception over and over but I managed to fix it. It was struggling when asked for a number between number next to each other.
- I still not totally sure why it works but it does.

Exercise 4:

- I started binary search the day of class in week 3 and it is now week 6 and I have only just managed to complete it so that shows my struggle.
- In the end the problem was that it counted another try when the algorithm guessed the correct number so that was really fun to figure out after 3 weeks of pain.
- I got it though
