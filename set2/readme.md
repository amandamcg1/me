TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

Exercise0:
Exercise 0 was ok because I have done python programming before so it was a good warm up and reminder of the things I have already learnt.
I learnt how to use f string formatting which is a simpler way to write our a string of words.

Exercise1:
Exercise 1 was beneficial in getting me thinking about how the logic of programming works.

Exercise2:
Exercise 2 helped me practise debugging and what the different brackets mean. I learnt what the map function can be used for.

Exercise3:
With exercise 3 the first couple of problems were ok but after that it got more challenging. The biggest issue was that I got the answer for some of them but it wasn't exactly what the tests were looking for. Like for loop 3 and 4 I had to change the numbers to strings and for the wedge I had get row grouped instead of individual items.
But overall, it was good.
