TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

This week we work on our datasets and working through the data. I was shown how to combine my 4 datasets into 1 singular list so that I would have access to a years worth of data.

I explored how to make a map using geopandas. I used the longitude and latitude given in the data to create point geometry so I could make maps.

I managed to get the points of show up but now I have to figure out how to get the outline of queensland to give context of the points.
