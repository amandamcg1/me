TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

In the beginning of the lesson, I was feeling ok because I have some experience with python. I installed and signed up to Github and Stackoverflow and followed through with the instructions well up until we had to test which is where everything went downhill. I got a bit overwhelmed and stressed as it wasn't working and cried a bit, but eventually I got everything set up as a developer environment. 

Overview of things I learnt:
- How to set up a developer environment
- How to test
- How to clone and fork
